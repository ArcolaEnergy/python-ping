This library is a fork of Pierre Bourdon <delroth@gmail.com>'s for of George 
Notaras' python-ping library, which is an implementation of the standard ICMP 
ping in pure Python.

As it uses raw ICMP sockets, you need to be root to use the functions exported 
by the ping module.

The license of the library remains unchanged (GPLv2), see COPYING.
